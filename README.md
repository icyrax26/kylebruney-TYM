This Year Matters
An Android app version of the First Year Matters website used by Salford University staff and students. 

JSON was used to pull data directly from the website and presented it in a mobile friendly view. In addition, actionbarsherlock was used to improve the design of the app.

This was a Salford University Group project carrying out the full mobile software development life cycle using agile practises
